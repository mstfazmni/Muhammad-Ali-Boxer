                <p><b>Muhammad Ali</b>, real name <b>Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr </b> was born on January 17, 1942 
                was an American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing" target="_blank"> professional boxer</a> and activist. Nicknamed <b>"the Greatest"</b><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greatest_(1977_film)" target="_blank">[Movie]</a></sup>,
                he is regarded as one of the most significant sports figures of the 20th century and is often regarded as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time.  
                He held the Ring magazine heavyweight title from 1964 to 1970. He was the undisputed champion from 1974 to 1978 and the WBA and Ring heavyweight champion from 1978 to 1979. In 1999,
                he was named Sportsman of the Century by Sports Illustrated and the Sports Personality of the Century by the BBC.
                Born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, he began training as an amateur boxer at age 12. At 18, he won a gold medal
                in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics and turned professional later that year. (wikipedia)<sup><a href="#refrence1">[1]</a></sup>

                <p>Muhammad Ali achieved renown as a boxer through his speed, superb footwork, ability to take a punch,
                and tremendous courage. His final record of 56 wins and 5 losses with 37 knockouts has been matched by others,
                but the quality of his opponents and his overwhelming success during his prime placed him among boxingâ€™s immortals.

                    By the end of his boxing career Ali had absorbed an estimated 200,000 hits.
                    In 1984, Ali was diagnosed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinsonism" target="_blank">Parkinson's syndrome</a> ,
                    which sometimes results from head trauma from violent physical activities
                    such as boxing. Ali still remained active during this time, later participating as a guest referee at 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania_I" target="_blank">WrestleMania I</a>.
